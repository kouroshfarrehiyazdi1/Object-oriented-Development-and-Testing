# CatShop Project

The CatShop project was undertaken as part of the Object-oriented Development and Testing module (CI553), providing an opportunity to engage with a deliberately convoluted legacy codebase. Led by the module instructor, Roger Evans, the project focused on the development and enhancement of the CatShop system. This Java-based application simulates a retail environment specifically designed for purchasing cat-related products.

## Overview

The primary goal of this project was to navigate and improve upon an existing codebase, addressing challenges associated with legacy code. Through practical hands-on experience, participants gained insights into object-oriented development principles, testing methodologies, and the intricacies of enhancing and maintaining complex software systems.
